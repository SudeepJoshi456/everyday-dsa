## I have created this repository to share each and every algorithm I solve while learning DSA in JAVA. 

### I take this as a motivator to push something regularly and improve my skills everyday. 

I'm starting with simpler algorithms and hope to eventually solve complex algorithms soon. 
I'll just push unique algorithms here, while I'll keep practicing on coding websites.
